# Churn-Prediction
Obtaining a new customer costs significantly more than retaining an existing customer. 
Therefore, it is beneficial for companies to understand why a customer decides to leave.
Churn prediction helps businesses develop loyalty programmes and retention campaigns to retain as many customers as possible. This project focuses on creating a model that can predict which customers are likely to churn (leave the service).
